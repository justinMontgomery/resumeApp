Basic resume app created by bun create vite my-app and ported over from pre-existing js/create-react-app, used to keep track of things that would appear on a resume without a ton of customization, mostly because it gets the point across and while I'm stronger at backend work I'm trying to get better at frontend.

Includes some github workflow for deploying to a static azure site and clearing the cdn on deploy.
